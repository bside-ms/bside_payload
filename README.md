# Payload CMS

## Current dev workflow

First install dependencies with `npm install`. Then at
`mongodb://localhost:27017/payload` as `MONGODB_URI` to your `.env` file and
run `docker compose up -d` to start the mongoDB instance.

When docker containers are running, CMS is available under http://localhost:3000.
