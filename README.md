# Payload CMS

## Current dev workflow

Just run `docker compose up`, it will install the dependencies and start dev server. You 
don't even need to create a `.env` file since the compose file comes with the necessary
environment variables ðŸš€

When docker containers are running, CMS is available under http://localhost:3000.
